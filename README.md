Invest Elevate  

🤑 Elevating Generations Through Investements 💰 

A finance based project based on Sip(Systematic Invest Planning) developed in Java-FX (java framework for UI).



💡Project Idea 💡-   

India is going to Achieve 5 Trillion economy till 2027 these are some of the trending headlines that we were seeing all over the social media, news headlines, etc. But what does this means ? 

Actually different sectors are responsible for the growth of Indian economy that are : 

1. Agricultural Modernization: 15-16%

2. Manufacturing and Industry Growth: 16-17%

3. Infrastructure Development: 8-9%

4. Digital Transformation (IT and related services): 7-8%

5. Financial Sector Reforms (Financial services): 6-7%

6. Human Capital Development (Education and skill development): 3-4%

7. Healthcare Improvements: 3-4%

8. Renewable Energy and Sustainability (Utilities): 2-3%

9. Tourism and Services Sector:

       a) Tourism and hospitality: 3-4%

       b) Overall services sector: 55-60%

10. Trade and Export Promotion (Merchandise exports): 12-13%

These sectors contribute the major parts and also maintains the flow of money in the country . Also there are several reasons that contribute to the Indian economy. 

Now from lockdown people come to know about the importance of investment . So, they were looking for options, major started with the stock market but since they were beginner so they were not aware of strategies, plans, candle stick pattern, how to read reports, analyze company , etc and so major of then loss their hard earn money 💵 .  Then after they started to look forward towards safer options that was SIP(Systematic Investing Planning). But the traditional investment method for sip was through agent, or through the bank which involve to much paper work and also limited options. So, from there I come upon an Idea to create a Project . The name of the Project is "Invest Elevate".

Slogan:  " 💸 Elevating Generations through Investments 💲 ". 



Concepts Used: 

1. Firebase: A platform by Google that provides backend services such as authentication, real-time database, cloud storage, and more.

2. FireStore: A NoSQL document database within Firebase used to store, sync, and query data for mobile, web, and server development.

3. API Binding: A process to connect and authenticate user credentials with backend services like Firebase.

4. Handling user-defined exceptions: Creating custom exceptions to handle specific error scenarios in a program.

5. Object creation: Instantiating a class to create an object using the new keyword.

 6. Access specifiers: Keywords (public, private, protected, default) that define the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables.

7. Package management: Organizing classes and interfaces into namespaces using the package keyword. 

8. Constructors: Special methods used to initialize objects when they are created. 

9. this keyword: A reference to the current object within an instance method or constructor.

10. Collections:  A framework in Java that provides a set of interfaces and classes for storing and manipulating groups of data as a single unit, such as lists, sets, and maps.

11. Runnable Interface: An interface representing a task that can be executed by a thread.

and many more. 



 
1. Firebase: Used for user authentication/authorization.

2. FireStore: Used to store and retrieve the data.

3. API Binding: Used API Binding to authenticate user credentials from Firebase.
