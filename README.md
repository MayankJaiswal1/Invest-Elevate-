These sectors contribute the major parts and also maintains the flow of money in the country . Also there are several reasons that contribute to the Indian economy. 

Now from lockdown people come to know about the importance of investment . So, they were looking for options, major started with the stock market but since they were beginner so they were not aware of strategies, plans, candle stick pattern, how to read reports, analyze company , etc and so major of then loss their hard earn money ðŸ’µ .  Then after they started to look forward towards safer options that was SIP(Systematic Investing Planning). But the traditional investment method for sip was through agent, or through the bank which involve to much paper work and also limited options. So, from there I come upon an Idea to create a Project . The name of the Project is "Invest Elevate".

Slogan:  " ðŸ’¸ Elevating Generations through Investments ðŸ’² ".
